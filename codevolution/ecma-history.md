## What is ECMAscript

### Going Back in time...

- In 1993, the first web browser with the user interface Mosaic was released
- In 1994, the lead developers of Mosaic founded a company called Netscape and released a more polished browser called Netscape navigator.
- At that time, web pages could only be static and there was no interactivity after a page was loaded.
- In 1995, Netscape created a new scripting language called Javascript
- The name was purely for marketing purpose as Java was the hot new language back then.

### The advent of Microsoft

- In 1995, Microsoft debuted their browser Internet Explorer
- Microsoft realized that Javascript fundamentally changed the user experience of the web and wanted the same for internet explorer.
- But there was no specification for them to follow
- In 1996, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Netscape interpreter to create its own scripting language called JScript
- The differences made it difficult for developers to make their website work well in both browsers.
- It was so difficult that websites have "Best viewed in Netscape" and "Best viewed in Explorer" badges

### ECMA International

- In Nov 1996, Netscape submitted Javascript to Ecma International.
- Ecma International is an industry association dedicated to the standardization of information and communication systems.
- Netscape wanted a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to as it would help keep other implementations consistent across browser.
- For each new specification, Ecma provide a standard specification and a committee.
- In case of Javascript the standard is called ECMA-262 and the committee that works on ECMA-262 is called Technical Committee 39(TC39)
- Ecma however decided to use the term "ECMAScript" to talk about the official language.
- This is because Oracle(who acquired Sun Microsystems) owns the trademark for the term "Javascript"
- ECMAScript refers to the standard language whereas Javascript is what we use in practice and builds on top of ECMAScript
